This is a Free Code Camp front end project written with CodePen. As the files are from CodePen, make sure to add Bootstrap and jQuery to them! Also need to link up style.css and client.js with index.html and add in the missing html tags (doctype/head/body etc, as they are automatically added when working in CodePen mode...). On the other hand, if you just copy and paste the content of the html (index.html)/css (style.css)/js (client.js) to their separate HTML/CSS/JS sections in CodePen it will just work.
